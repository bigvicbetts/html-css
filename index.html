        <h1>Early Life</h1>
            <p>
                I was born in Detroit Lakes, MN on <time datetime="1981-12-05">Dec. 5, 1981</time>.  I 
                have five brother and four sisters.  I am the second youngest of my siblings (I have one 
                younger sister).  <aside>
                    An interesting fact is that I actually share my birthday with my next older sister as 
                    well as my younger sister.  I am exactly two years younger than my next older sister 
                    and three years older than my younger sister.
                </aside>  When I was less than a year old, my family moved from Minnessota to Chattanooga, TN 
                where I was raised.  I attended Tennessee Temple Academy from second grade until graduating 
                high school in 2000.
            </p>
        <h1>College And Beyond</h1>
            <p>
                After graduating high school, I went on to college at UT Chattanooga.  While visiting a friend 
                at Texas A&M, though, I met the love of my life.  After making the 26 hour round-trip from 
                Chattanooga to College Station four times in the span of six months just to see her, I transferred 
                to UT Arlington so pursue our relationship.  On August 7, 2004 we got married at her church in 
                Arlington.  While we have certainly had our ups and downs, we have weathered every storm we've 
                come across and now have three amazing children to help brighten our days even more.
            </p>
